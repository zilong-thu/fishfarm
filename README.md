# fishfarm
A presentational light weight website for my father's fish farm.

Using node.js, express.js, bootstrap, etc, this website is quickly built up.

Videos are stored in Qiniu cloud. Images are in the web app directory `/images` except some large ones.

```
git clone https://github.com/zilong-thu/fishfarm.git
cd fishfarm
npm install
npm start
```
and the server will be listening on port 8000.

Now the website looks like this:
